# map-color
Personal Project drawing a map to color
Program will create a canvas, ask for a number of lines, ask for a number of curves and then draw a canvas of those randomly placed lines and curves. This will be the random map.
Following this, the program will determine the number of shapes contained and then color the polygons with the minimum possible colors.
